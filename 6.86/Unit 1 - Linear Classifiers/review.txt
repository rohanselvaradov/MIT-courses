"Oatmeal Squares" is in about the largest print you can fit on the Front of the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a "Crunchy Oat Cereal".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker, which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.  This is really "Oatmeal and Wheat Squares"<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is.
